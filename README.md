## Attributes
All attributes start at 1. Each attribute has two related pools that equals the value of the attribute * 10.

* Physique -Health/Equipment Load
* Skill -Stamina/Skill Capacity
* Attunement -Mana/Spellbook Capacity

## Experience And Levels

Levels are tracked by attribute and experience is divided up according to the way it's specified by the player. This can be changed at any time. You have a total of 15 focus points to assign and each attribute has a minimum of 1. Assign the points however you like, here's a couple ideas.

## Some example Builds:


 
| | Focused  |
| ---: | :--- |
| T | *************  |
| Q | * | 
| S | * |

With the focused build most of the experience gained will go into one attribute with a small amount going into the other 2.

| | Dual Focus  |
| ---: | :--- |
| T | *******  |
| Q | ******* | 
| S | * |

Dual focus has most experience split between two attributes.

| | Balanced  |
| ---: | :--- |
| T | ***** |
| Q | ***** | 
| S | *****|

You get the idea!

## Equipment
Each piece of equipment has an Equipment Load requirement.
